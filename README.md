# sentiment-analysis
This dataset contains 82,815 reviews from Amazon about cell phones from 2004 up until Sep
2019. Each review can be associated with an item and brand name and comes with a rating
ranging from 1 to 5. This makes the dataset a perfect sample for text analytics and sentiment
classification.
With multiple wordclouds and bar charts we found out that the two most popular brands are
Apple and Samsung, and 96% iPhone offerings are renewed/refurbished models sold by carriers.
Among all brands Xiaomi has the highest rating. Therefore we would deep dive into these three
brands.
The project also includes a non-supervised sentiment classification using VADER in the end.
There is a strong positive correlation between the sentiment and the rating, which shows that
VADER model is actually a very powerful tool.
